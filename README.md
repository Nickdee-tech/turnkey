fibonacci sequence

Import Scanner class: Used for user input.
main method: The program entry point.
getValidInput method:
Prompts the user for a positive integer.
Uses a do-while loop to keep prompting until a valid input is received.
Uses a loop within the do-while to handle non-integer input and clear the scanner buffer.
Returns the validated positive integer entered by the user.
Print initial prompt: Asks the user for the number of terms.
printFibonacciSequence method:
Takes the number of terms as input.
Initializes firstTerm and secondTerm for the sequence.
Prints the initial two terms (0 and 1).
Uses a for loop to iterate for the remaining terms:
Calculates the next term using the previous two.
Prints the calculated next term.
Updates firstTerm and secondTerm for the next iteration.

largest difference

Function definition: findLargestDifference takes a List<Integer> as input and returns an integer.
Base case handling: If the list size is less than 2, it returns 0 as there won't be a difference.
Initialize variables:
min is set to the maximum possible integer value (Integer.MAX_VALUE) to ensure the first encountered number becomes the initial minimum.
max is set to the minimum possible integer value (Integer.MIN_VALUE) to ensure the first encountered number becomes the initial maximum.
Iterate through the list:
For each number (num) in the list:
Use Math.min(min, num) to update min if num is smaller than the current minimum.
Use Math.max(max, num) to update max if num is larger than the current maximum.
Calculate and return difference: After iterating through all numbers, max will hold the largest value and min will hold the smallest value. We use Math.abs(max - min) to get the absolute value of their difference, ensuring a positive result.
This function efficiently handles lists of any size and with duplicate elements. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the list and returns the absolute difference between them as the largest difference.

databases

SELECT *: This selects all columns from the employees table.
FROM employees: This specifies the table to query from.
WHERE: This clause specifies the filtering condition for selecting rows.
age > 30: This selects employees with age greater than 30.
AND salary > 50000.00: This further filters the results to only include employees with a salary greater than $50,000.00 (using a decimal point to specify a float value).
This query will return a table containing all columns (*) for employees who meet both the age and salary criteria.

average calculator

The "AverageCalculator" class and "calculateAverage" method seem fine for calculating the average of an array of integers. However, there's a potential issue with the calculation of the average due to integer division, which may result in loss of precision. To fix this, you should convert "total or numbers.length" to a double before performing the division.
